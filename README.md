# 🔐 File Encryption and Decryption using Python
This project demonstrates a simple yet secure way to encrypt and decrypt text files using the Fernet module from Python’s cryptography library.

## 📌 Features
- Generates a secure encryption key.
- Encrypts the content of a file and saves it as a new encrypted file.
- Decrypts the encrypted file back to its original form.
- Saves the key securely for future encryption/decryption.

## 📁 Files
- mykey.key: Stores the generated Fernet encryption key.
- encrypt_decrypt.txt: Your original input file.
- enc_encrypt_decrypt.txt: Encrypted version of the input file.
- dec_encrypt_decrypt.txt: Decrypted version (should match the original).

## 🧪 How It Works
- Generate a secure key and save it to a .key file.
- Read the original file and encrypt its contents.
- Save the encrypted data to a new file.
- Decrypt the encrypted file using the same key.
- Save the decrypted content to verify it matches the original.

## ▶️ Usage
Install the required library:
```
pip install cryptography
```
Run the script:
```
python your_script_name.py
```
Make sure your input file encrypt_decrypt.txt exists in the same directory before running the script.

## 🛡️ Dependencies
- Python 3.x
- cryptography library
